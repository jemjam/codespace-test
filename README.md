# Jamkus for Codespaces

This is a quick node project template for demoing Codespaces. It is based off of the [Azure node sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world). It's great!!!

I was able to edit everything in a browser window with something very similar to
a codespace. With settings sync it instantly and quickly looks like my own
vscode.

Pretty rad all around... very useful to pop open an editor inside your browser.
